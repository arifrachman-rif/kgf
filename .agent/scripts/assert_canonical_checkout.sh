# Background: on 3 Aug 2026 an entire evening's work was written to the Windows
# copy while all 19 cron jobs wrote to the WSL copy. The two drifted in BOTH
# directions, and documents were published to Drive from the stale side before
# anyone noticed. Nothing warned, because nothing was watching.
#
# The rule that came out of it is no longer "one machine is canonical". It is
# origin/main is the source of truth, WSL is the automation host, macOS is a
# first-class interactive checkout. So this script watches every checkout for
# the two ways a machine goes stale: behind origin, or holding work it never
# pushed. The old version only ever checked the WSL path, which is why the
# macOS clone could sit a week behind in silence.
#
# Exit is always 0. This informs, it does not block. It also makes no network
# call: the SessionStart hook budget is ~10s, and session_git_sync.py runs
# right after this and does the real fetch/pull.

# desktop app over \\wsl.localhost (9P, which reports none). They share one
# .git/config, so a repo-local core.filemode=true -- which `git clone` on Linux
# writes by default -- makes the Windows side manufacture a 100755 => 100644
# deletion for EVERY tracked executable. On 8 Aug 2026 that was 52 phantom
# entries, indistinguishable from real work in `git status`. Committing them
# would have stripped +x off ~21 cron scripts for real, surfacing later as an
# opaque "permission denied" from cron (precedent: b32a77f).

# in each OS's global config. Repo-local always wins, so it has to go.
