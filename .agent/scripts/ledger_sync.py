"""ledger_sync.py - push a ledger change out to every view of it, immediately.

Why this exists
---------------
`ledger_lock.py` fixed *corruption*: two writers no longer drop each other's
records. It did nothing about *latency*. After a record changed, four things
still had to happen before anyone else could see it, and all four were left to
a cron job or to whoever remembered:

    journal/state/<ledger>.json      <- the write itself, instant
    journal/state/*.index.json       <- stale until state_index.py ran
    journal/master_followup_tracker.md
                                     <- stale until render_followup_tracker.py ran
    origin/main                      <- stale until something committed + pushed

Between the write and the last of those, every other session and every cron job
reading this repo saw the old value. On a repo where several Claude sessions and
19 cron jobs run against the same tree, "stale until the next daily run" means a
closed commitment gets chased again, a signed-off decision gets re-litigated, and
a briefing reports an item that was finished hours earlier.

So: the moment a ledger mutates, re-render everything derived from it and get it
onto origin/main. One function, called by the ledger CLIs themselves, so it
cannot be forgotten.

Commands
--------
    ledger_sync.py sync [--ledger NAME] [--reason "close COM-0123"]
        Re-render derived views, commit the state paths, pull --rebase if
        origin moved, push. Safe to run any time; a no-op when nothing changed.

    ledger_sync.py check
        Report drift without changing anything. Exit 0 clean, 1 drifted.
        Used by the Stop hook.

    ledger_sync.py refresh [--max-age S]
        The read side. Throttled fetch; pull when origin has newer ledger
        commits and pulling is safe. Used by the PreToolUse freshness hook.

    ledger_sync.py status
        Human-readable summary of last sync per ledger.

Safety
------
* Only the paths in SYNC_PATHS are ever staged. Whatever else is dirty in the
  tree is left exactly as it was, so this never sweeps up in-progress work.
* Never raises into the caller. A ledger write must not fail because the network
  was down; failures are recorded in journal/state/ledger_sync.json and surfaced
  by the Stop hook instead.
* `LEDGER_SYNC_OFFLINE=1` skips all network git. `LEDGER_SYNC_DISABLE=1` skips
  everything including rendering.

# deletion guard: the one check that spans both machines
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# On 17 Aug 2026 two records were added on macOS at 11:53 WIB (d4152a8a,
# b6172f83) and deleted fourteen minutes later by the WSL cron sweep (b2644a58,
# 50 deletions and 0 insertions, -"id": "WAIT-0342" and -"id": "WAIT-0343").
# Nothing was corrupt and nothing raced on one filesystem. The WSL box simply
# read a `waiting_on.json` that had never seen the two records, wrote its whole
# snapshot back, and git carried the deletion forward.
#
# That is the failure `ledger_lock.py` cannot see, by construction: `fcntl` is a
# single-filesystem primitive, so it fires zero times across two clones. A
# content digest fares no better -- the bytes on the WSL disk genuinely had not
# changed between its read and its write.
#
# What DOES span both machines is git, because every ledger mutation here is
# already a commit. So the check is: before committing, compare the record ids
# on disk against HEAD and against origin/main, and refuse when one has
# vanished. This sits below every other layer, which is the point -- it catches
# cron, a hand-edit, the headless worker in weekly_ledger_audit.py, and the
# other machine, none of which a lock or a Claude Code hook can reach.
#
# The exemption is the record's STATUS, not the invoking command. An earlier
# draft gated on the command name (close/drop/delete/prune) and was wrong:
# `waiting_watchdog.cmd_sweep` calls `prune()` on every hourly run, deleting
# answered and dropped items past DROPPED_RETENTION_DAYS. A command allowlist
# either includes `sweep`, which waves through the exact incident above, or
# excludes it and fires every hour until someone switches the guard off.
#
# Keying on status is both correct and stronger: it is command-agnostic, so a
# hand-edit that drops an open record is caught the same way a sweep is.

# Where the records live, and which statuses may legitimately disappear.
# `None` for terminal_statuses means "this ledger is not keyed by record id";

# background sync: take the sync off the turn's critical path
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# A sync is propagation, and nothing in the turn that triggered it reads the
# result. Run in the foreground from the Stop hook it cost 30 to 72 seconds of
# wall clock on every single turn on the macOS checkout: roughly half in the
# renderers (`render_followup_tracker.py` shells out to three ledger CLIs) and
# half in `git fetch` plus `push` over a link from Indonesia to GitHub. the owner
# waited for all of it before he could read the reply.
#
# So the Stop hook now detaches it. Correctness is unchanged, because every
# guarantee this module makes is enforced inside the child: the ledger locks,
# the deletion guard, the rebase-and-retry push. The only thing given up is
# seeing the result inside the same turn, and `bg_last_result()` hands the
# previous run's outcome to the next turn so a failure still surfaces.
#
# One sync at a time. Two detached children would race on the index and on the
# push, so the child takes an exclusive non-blocking lock and a second one exits
# rather than queueing. Whatever it would have committed is still dirty in the
# tree, so the next turn's sync picks it up.
