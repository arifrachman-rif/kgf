"""Stop hook: nothing tracked leaves this turn un-recorded or un-propagated.

Two checks, in this order.

1. PROPAGATE. If anything under `journal/state/` or the generated tracker is
   still uncommitted at the end of the turn, sync it: re-render the derived
   views, commit, push. A ledger change that only exists in this working tree is
   invisible to every other session and to all 19 cron jobs, and the next sweep
   that writes the same file can silently drop it. This runs automatically and
   does not interrupt anyone.

2. RECORD. `ledger_watch.py` logged the actions taken this turn that normally
   discharge a tracked item - a Slack message sent, a doc published, a ticket
   transitioned. If one of those happened and no ledger command followed it, the
   record still says open. That is the failure this whole mechanism exists to
   prevent, so it blocks once and names the specific action, then lets the turn
   end whatever happens next (`stop_hook_active` guards against a loop).

Contract: exit 0 always; blocking is expressed in the JSON, never by exit code.
