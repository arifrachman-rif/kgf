"""Reconcile Fathom recordings against MOM files, and alarm on the gap.

Why this exists
---------------
Every other part of the meeting pipeline is capture-artifact-driven: the
watcher loops over .wav files that appeared, and the Vexa dispatcher fires a
bot and never looks back. Both are structurally blind to the meetings they
missed, because an empty recordings dir is indistinguishable from a day with
no meetings. On 16 Jul 2026 that dropped YourManager's mandatory Product/Growth/PMO
weekly (62 min, 12 decisions) while vexa-auto logged 19 "ok" heartbeats.

This script inverts the question. Instead of "an artifact appeared, what do I
do with it?" it asks "a meeting happened, where is its MOM?" and it asks it
against Fathom, the only record of what happened that this harness does not
produce itself. It fires on ABSENCE, which nothing else here can do.

The day is enumerated from LIVE Fathom, not from the local registry. The
registry (journal/fathom_registry.json) is a downstream artifact written only
by the evening sync, so mid-day it holds zero rows for today and the checker
went blind. We now query Fathom directly for the day and keep the registry
purely as an enrichment cache (matched_meeting title, related_recordings,
mom_path backlinks). If live Fathom is unreachable we mark the run
non-authoritative and exit 2 rather than reporting a false clean day.

Coverage for a Fathom recording resolves in this order:
  1. its own mom_path exists on disk
  2. any related_recordings entry has a mom_path on disk
  3. any registry row sharing date_wib + matched_meeting has a mom_path
     (Fathom / Vexa / local all land in the registry, so this is the dedupe key)
  4. a MOM_<Title>_<date>.md filed under Clients/Work/**/meetings/ fuzzy-matches

A MOM that exists but is tiny, or is filed under a non-meeting calendar block,
counts as SUSPECT rather than covered: a false-positive MOM reads as done and
hides the miss, which is worse than an outright gap. Size is also not proof
of substance: a MOM that clears the byte threshold but contains zero
decisions and zero action items is downgraded to SUSPECT too (an 11-minute
Vexa draft cleared MIN_MOM_BYTES by 156 bytes on 30 Jul 2026 while capturing
nothing). A recording that ended less than the grace window ago has
legitimately not been minuted yet and is bucketed as PENDING, which does NOT
trip the gap alarm.

Fathom enumeration is still blind to a meeting nobody ever hit record on --
it produces zero rows, which looks identical to no meeting having happened.
So the day is enumerated a second time from Google Calendar (best-effort: a
calendar-fetch failure does not affect authoritativeness, only Fathom does),
and any substantial calendar event that matches no Fathom row lands in
UNCOUNTED, which also trips the gap alarm. Root-caused on 30 Jul 2026: 7
calendar meetings, only 5 had notes, and 2 (ExampleCo daily standup, Product x
Ops Weekly) were never recorded and never appeared as a gap.

Usage:
  python3 meeting-recorder/mom_reconcile.py [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--quiet]
Exit codes: 0 = fully covered, 1 = gaps found, 2 = could not run / verify.
